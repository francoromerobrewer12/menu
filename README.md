WELCOME TO THE RESTAURANT MENU PROJECT!

This project consists of four buttons which have a data-id attribute that I use to find out which of them the user clicks. 

Once clicked, I store the attributeÂ´s value in "category" using useState and I use that variable to filter an array of objects (MENU). 

After I filter the array depending of the category that the user wants to see on screen y use the map function to return a menuItem component for each object in the filtered array.
